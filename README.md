# ArcJS

###### [_beta_.__`v4.5.5`__]()

__ArcJS__ provides a set of modules to improve front-end UIs development. Designed to let create full interactive UIs in manner of a few minutes. Also provides a handy set of _utils functions_, _dynamic script importing__ and _user authentication__.

## Build 

Firts lets create the distribution bundle. In order to do that, install node's dependencies. From command line run:

```bash
>_ npm install
```

The install [__Grunt__](https://gruntjs.com/) and run:

```bash
>_ grunt proto 
```

## Testing

It had been added a behavior-driven testing framework: [__jasmine__](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html).

To execute the proto spec run:

```bash
>_ npx jasmine .\src\test\proto.arc.spec.js
```

To see the installation process check it out theirs [documentation](https://jasmine.github.io/setup/nodejs.html).

### Getting Started

This section had been moved to its own project __ArcUI__, which is in the documentation phase.
